🚔 **Analyzing how multimillion-dollar military surplus equipment is used in Texas’ law enforcement agencies:**

Inspired by this [BuzzFeed News article](https://www.buzzfeednews.com/article/jimdalrympleii/war-zone-in-ferguson-how-billions-in-military-weapons-ended) about how billions in military weapons ended up in the hands of local police in Ferguson, Mo., after the death of Michael Brown. I used data from the [“1033 program”](https://www.dla.mil/Disposition-Services/Offers/Law-Enforcement/Program-FAQs/) handled through the [Law Enforcement Support Office](https://www.dla.mil/Disposition-Services/Offers/Law-Enforcement/Public-Information/) to analyze how Central Texas police agencies have used the federal program.

👉 **Questions to answer:**

- _All answers based on data about Texas agencies from Jan. 1, 2010 to present._ 
- How many total “controlled” items were transferred, and what are they all worth? Summarize all the controlled items only to get the total quantity and total value of everything.
- How many total “controlled” items did each agency get and how much was it all worth? Which agency got the most stuff?
- How about local agencies? 
- What specific “controlled” items did each agency get and how much were they worth? Look at the kinds of items.
- What did local agencies get?
